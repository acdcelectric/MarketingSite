<h2>
  4. Payment
</h2>

<p>
  You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services
  you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges”). After you have received services
  obtained through your use of the Service, ELECTRICWEB will facilitate your payment of
  the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party
  Provider's limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner
  shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party
  Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges
  paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by
  ELECTRICWEB. All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by
  ELECTRICWEB using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after
  which ELECTRICWEB will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account
  payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be
  charged, you agree that ELECTRICWEB may, as the Third Party Provider's limited
  payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if
  available. As between you and ELECTRICWEB, ELECTRICWEB reserves the right to
  establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services obtained through the
  use of the Services at any time in ELECTRICWEB's sole discretion. ELECTRICWEB
  may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers, subscriptions and
  discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services
  obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers,
  subscriptions and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing
  on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your
  request for services from a Third Party Provider at least 15 minutes prior to start of the
  booked time slot, post which you may be charged a cancellation fee equivalent to the
  entire applicable Service Charge. This payment structure is intended to fully
  compensate the Third Party Provider for the services provided. After you have received
  services obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your
  experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider

Third Party Providers’ Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure and property resulting
from use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal “wear and tear”
damages and necessary repairs (“Repair”). In the event that a Third Party Provider
reports the need for Repair and such Repair request is verified by ELECTRICWEB in
ELECTRICWEB’s reasonable discretion, ELECTRICWEB reserves the right to facilitate
payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair on behalf of the Third Party Provider
using your payment method designated in your Account. Such amounts will be
transferred by ELECTRICWEB to the applicable Third Party Provider and are nonrefundable.

<h3>
  ELECTRICWEB GUIDELINES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES
</h3>

<p>
  The following guidelines are intended to inform law enforcement about the legal process
for seeking records from ELECTRICWEB. These are merely guidelines, and this
information may change at any time. For private party requests, including requests from
civil litigants and criminal defendants, we recommend browsing Guidelines for Third
Party Data Requests
</p>

<br>

<h3>
  WHAT IS ELECTRICWEB AND WHAT RECORDS DO WE HAVE?
</h3>
<p>
  ELECTRICWEB is a technology company that has developed an app that connects
users (Electric Vehicle Owners) with Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure partners
who provide Electric Vehicle Charging Services to the user. ELECTRICWEB is not an
Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Provider, and does not employ any Electric
Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Providers. Users can use the ELECTRICWEB App to
request Electric Vehicle Charging via their smartphone. At the end of the Electric
Vehicle Charging, both the Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure partner and user
receive a copy of the receipt. More information about our services is available here. We
store and maintain information as described in our Privacy Statements and our Terms of
Use.

</p>

<br>
<h3>
  WHAT TYPE OF LEGAL PROCESS DOES ELECTRICWEB REQUIRE BEFORE
  PRODUCING USER OR PARTNER INFORMATION?
  
</h3>
<p>
  We disclose business records only in accordance with our terms of service and
  applicable law. We accept requests via email to 
  <a href="">support@acdcelectric.in </a>
  or via personal
  service to the following address: ACDC ELCTRIC, UB-36A, Antriksh Bhawan, 22 K.G.
  Marg, New Delhi- 110001, India. Our acceptance of legal process does not waive any
  legal objections ELECTRICWEB may have and may raise in response to the request.
  
</p>
<br>
<h3>
  WHAT FORM OF REQUESTS DOES ELECTRICWEB REQUIRE, AND HOW ARE
REQUESTS PROCESSED? 
</h3>
<p>
  To respond to a request, we will need to receive the applicable process described
above, as well as a valid return email address from an official government domain. We
review each request for facial and substantive validity, and will reject requests that are
not facially and substantively valid. Among other things, we require requests to be
narrowly tailored to a legitimate law enforcement need and will reject overly broad,
vague, or unduly burdensome requests. In order to make sure your Law Enforcement
Request is valid and does not seek more information than necessary, we ask for the
following: A sufficiently narrow/defined time period; A specific event or action that the
subject took; A specific reference (i.e., you must uniquely identify a user or Electric
Vehicle Charging Infrastructure partner) We disclose data to law enforcement when we
determine that we are required to do so by law. In those instances, we will search for
and disclose data that we are reasonably able to locate and retrieve.

</p>
<br>
<h3>
  HOW DOES ELECTRICWEB HANDLE EMERGENCY REQUESTS?
</h3>

<p>
  We have a process for evaluating requests on an emergency basis where there is an
emergency that involves protecting a user, Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure
partner, or third party or stopping illegal activity that poses an immediate threat of death
or serious bodily harm.
